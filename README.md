# ODriveCanbus (Work in progress)

An implementation of the ODrive Canbus protocol for the Arduino platform.

Only a few messages implemented so far.

Working on a Teensy 4.1 with https://github.com/tonton81/FlexCAN_T4 handling the low-level stuff.

Under the right conditions, this inelegant sketch will calibrate and spin a motor.
